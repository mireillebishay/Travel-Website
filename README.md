# Travel-Website
The goal of this project is to create a network application using the client/server architecture. The web application serves as a basic travel website, which allows users to search for various travel destinations. Users are able to sign up for an account, add places to their "want-to-go list," and search for travel destinations. The website is initially hosted on the machine's "local host," and once completed, it is hosted online on the cloud platform render.com.
